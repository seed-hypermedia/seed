# go-libp2p-pubsub examples

This directory contains example projects that use [go-libp2p-pubsub](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub),
the Go implementation of libp2p's [Publish / Subscribe system](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/publish-subscribe).

- The [chat room example](./chat) covers the basics of using the PubSub API to build a peer-to-peer chat application.
- The [pubsub rendezvous example](./basic-chat-with-rendezvous) allows multiple peers to chat among each other using go-libp2p-pubsub using rendezvous names.
