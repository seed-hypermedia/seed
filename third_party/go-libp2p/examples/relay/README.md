# Relay-based P2P Communication Example

## Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of a relay-based peer-to-peer communication using the libp2p library in Go. It features creating unreachable libp2p hosts and facilitating their communication through a relay node.

## Features
- Creation of two "unreachable" libp2p hosts.
- Setup of a relay node to enable communication between these hosts.

## Usage

Run the program 
   ```bash
   go run . 
   ```
