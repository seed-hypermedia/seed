<!--
  This is an entrypoint for testing device linking workflow locally on different devices.
  Testing device linking with the real Remix app is currently very complicated, and feedback loop is slow.
  The idea of this page is to run it with Bun, and expose Bun's dev server on the local network to test it on a different device.
  It needs to exposed with HTTPs, because Web Crypto API is only available in secure contexts or localhost,
  but when you open this page on the phone it's not going to be localhost.

  To expose the server via HTTPs either [mkcert], [ngrok], or something similar.
  I like to use [Tailscale Serve].

  To run this page use `bun run --hot ./frontend/apps/web/app/device-linking_test.html`.

  [mkcert]: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert.
  [ngrok]: https://ngrok.com.
  [Tailscale Serve]: https://tailscale.com/kb/1312/serve.
