# Performance Dashboard

A modern visualization tool for desktop application performance metrics.

## Overview

This dashboard provides a visual interface to explore performance test results for the desktop application. It reads JSON files generated by the performance test suite and displays metrics, traces, and screenshots in an organized and user-friendly way.

## Features

- View all performance test reports
- Examine detailed metrics for each test scenario
- Access performance traces and screenshots
- Compare results across different test runs
- Visualize performance trends over time

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Yarn package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn
```

### Development Server

```bash
# Start the development server
yarn dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the dashboard for production
yarn build

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Source code
  - `App.tsx` - Main application component
  - `types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for performance data
  - `utils/` - Utility functions
    - `data.ts` - Functions for loading performance data

## Integration with Performance Tests

The dashboard reads performance test results from the `../performance/performance-results` directory. The performance test suite generates JSON files in this directory, which are then consumed by the dashboard.

## Deployment

The dashboard can be deployed as a static site. The build output is in the `dist/` directory and can be served by any static file server.
