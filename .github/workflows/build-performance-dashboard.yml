name: Build Performance Dashboard

# This workflow is responsible for building and deploying the performance dashboard.
# It runs in three scenarios:
# 1. When changes are made to the dashboard code
# 2. When manually triggered via workflow_dispatch
# 3. On a daily schedule to pick up any new performance results
#
# The desktop app build workflow (dev-desktop.yml) uploads performance results to S3
# but does not build the dashboard itself. This workflow centralizes all dashboard building.
