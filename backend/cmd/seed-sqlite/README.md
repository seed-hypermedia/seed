# SQLite Shell

This is a vibe-coded custom SQLite shell (REPL), which lets you interactively execute SQL queries against an SQLite database.

It serves the same purpose as the official SQLite shell, but of course it's much more limited in functionality.

The main purpose of this shell is to provide SQLite with all of our custom extensions and utilities, which are sometimes useful for quick testing and prototyping.
