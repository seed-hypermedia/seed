# Raw Account ID

This is generally how Accounts are identified in the first.

The Account Public Key is directly embedded in [IPLD binary data](./binary-data.md). As JSON, an author may be encoded as such:

```json
  "author": {
    "/": {
      "bytes": "7QFJUy+fggkk/uHRKUeBRqNRrJdlc1ZCA0addDO+nwgPpA"
    }
  },
```
