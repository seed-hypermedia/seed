# Table block

A table container. Its children are TableColumn blocks (childless; their sibling order defines column display order) followed by TableRow blocks whose children are Paragraph cells carrying a columnId attribute — cell identity is (row, columnId), never grid position, which is what lets concurrent CRDT edits merge cleanly.


This document describes the **hypermedia-block-table** type — a Hypermedia Network blob schema. Its formal schema is attached (the `schemaDefinition` in this document's metadata), so the app can show it and create values of this type.

## Shape

**Extends** [hypermedia-block-base](hm://z6MkmZUb4K5c17zGGBuJJerwFzBaGkiYLfEEnkb9CH1W1ptb/hypermedia-block-base) with these added fields:

- `type` — `string` enum: `Table`
- `attributes` — map { 2 fields }

## Depends on

- [hypermedia-block-base](hm://z6MkmZUb4K5c17zGGBuJJerwFzBaGkiYLfEEnkb9CH1W1ptb/hypermedia-block-base)
- [hypermedia-children-type](hm://z6MkmZUb4K5c17zGGBuJJerwFzBaGkiYLfEEnkb9CH1W1ptb/hypermedia-children-type)
- [float](hm://z6MkmZUb4K5c17zGGBuJJerwFzBaGkiYLfEEnkb9CH1W1ptb/float)
