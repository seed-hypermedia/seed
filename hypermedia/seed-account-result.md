# Account result

The result of resolving an account: its metadata payload, or an explicit not-found. A derived read model computed by the Seed daemon/API for clients — not a signed network blob.


This document describes the **seed-account-result** type — a Seed API read-model schema (derived data the daemon computes for clients, not a signed network blob). Its formal schema is attached (the `schemaDefinition` in this document's metadata), so the app can show it and create values of this type.

## Shape

A **union** — a value matches one of these variants:

- map { 4 fields }
- map { 2 fields }

## Depends on
